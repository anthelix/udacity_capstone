[Here](https://anthelix.github.io/blog/), I write a blog during my capstaone project. 

The demography of the United States was built thanks to the arrival of the first settlers of various European nationalities. In the 20th century, the population increased due to immigration. Here I would like to make the link with the world news and the variations of the entry to the USA via the airports. `< prendre aussi d'autres moyens que les aeroports? route , bateaux?>`

I'll look at the `[US National Tourism and Trade Office](https://travel.trade.gov/research/reports/i94/historical/2016.html)` along with various immigration and other information about arriving person. I-94 Website is the Official Site for Travelers Visisting the United States. An I-94 form is needed by all Air and Sea travelers. 
The GDELT Project, [here](https://www.gdeltproject.org/), monitors the news around our world. 
These will form the base of my project. I need to add more information.
